    <h1>Desert Tycoon - Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Last updated: October 31, 2024</strong></p>

    <p>Semilon Games built the <strong>Desert Tycoon</strong> app as a <strong>Free</strong> app. This service is provided by Semilon Games at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page informs visitors of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone choosing to use our Service.</p>

    <p>By using this Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in line with this policy. The Personal Information we collect is used to provide and improve the Service, and we will not share your information except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>For a better experience, we may request certain personally identifiable information. This information remains on your device and is not collected by us.</p>
    <p>The app may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you. These third-party service providers include:</p>
    <ul class="third-party-list">
        <li>Google Play Services</li>
        <li>AdMob</li>
        <li>Unity</li>
        <li>AdColony</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>In case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) called Log Data. This data may include your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, the time and date of your use, and other statistics.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are files with small amounts of data used as unique identifiers. While our Service does not use cookies explicitly, third-party libraries in the app may use them to collect information to improve their services. You may accept or refuse cookies, but refusing them may impact the Service's functionality.</p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related tasks on our behalf</li>
        <li>To analyze how our Service is used</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information to perform tasks on our behalf. They are obligated not to disclose or use the information for other purposes.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, and we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>This Service may contain links to external sites. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We recommend reviewing the Privacy Policy of these websites, as we have no control over their content or privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately. If you are a parent or guardian aware of such data being shared, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Please review this page periodically for any changes, which will be posted here.</p>
